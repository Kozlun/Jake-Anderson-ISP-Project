# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data regarding the conditions of North American boreal forests after they have been damaged by fires. This data will allow us to make predictions regarding forest fires. These predictions include things like the expected speed at which an area will recover from fire damage, or the degree of damage that may be expected to occur in a particular area based on the conditions.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about boreal forests throughout North America after they sustained damage from fire. Data was collected over the course of twenty-five years. Some of the most important columns of the dataset are the burn year, the count year (the year the measurements took place), moisture, and canopy combustion.
